# Team Salary Calculator
Application that allows calculating the salary of the soccer team

<p align="justify">
The salary of soccer team players is made up of two parts: a fixed salary and a variable bonus, the sum of these two parts is the salary of a player. The variable bonus is made up of two parts: individual goal and team goal, each weighing 50%.


## How are goal ranges and bonuses calculated?

The individual goal per player depends on the level assigned to him:


| Level    |Goals/month|
|----------|:---------:|
| A        |     5     |
| B        |    10     |
| C        |    15     |
| Cuauh    |    20     |


**Example:** Juan, Pedro, Mart√≠n and Luis scored like this during the month:

|Player| Level |Goals scored in the month / minimum required|
|------|-------|--------------------------------------------|
|Juan  | A     |     6/5                                    |
|Pedro | B     |    7/10                                    |
|Martin| C     |    16/15                                   |
|Luis  | Cuauh |    19/20                                   |
|total |       |    48/50                                   |

<p align="justify">
The team bonus they would have a reach of 96%, Luis would have an individual reach of 95% for a total reach of 95.5% Luis's fixed floor is 50,000.00 and his bonus is 10,000.00 so his final salary will be $ 59,550.00

## Test

The application should receive as input a JSON with this structure:

```javascript
[  
   {  
      "nombre":"Juan Perez",
      "nivel":"C",
      "goles":10,
      "sueldo":50000,
      "bono":25000,
      "sueldo_completo":null,
      "equipo":"rojo"
   },
   {  
      "nombre":"EL Cuauh",
      "nivel":"Cuauh",
      "goles":30,
      "sueldo":100000,
      "bono":30000,
      "sueldo_completo":null,
      "equipo":"azul"
   },
   {  
      "nombre":"Cosme Fulanito",
      "nivel":"A",
      "goles":7,
      "sueldo":20000,
      "bono":10000,
      "sueldo_completo":null,
      "equipo":"azul"

   },
   {  
      "nombre":"El Rulo",
      "nivel":"B",
      "goles":9,
      "sueldo":30000,
      "bono":15000,
      "sueldo_completo":null,
      "equipo":"rojo"

   }
]
```


The output must fill the key salary_complete with the correct amount of each player.    

```javascript
[
   {  
      "nombre":"El Rulo",
      "goles_minimos":10,
      "goles":9,
      "sueldo":30000,
      "bono":15000,
      "sueldo_completo": 14250,
      "equipo":"rojo"
   }
]
```
